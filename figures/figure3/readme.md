Matlab Code to generate Fig. 3

Just run plot...m file to generate the figure.

It inputs one of 3 datasets (you need to select which one at the top of the code), that can be chosen to generate the choice sets described in Fig. 3.

The inputs are:

distributions6.m, corresponding to the flat environment

distributions62.m, rich environment

distributions63.m, poor environment
