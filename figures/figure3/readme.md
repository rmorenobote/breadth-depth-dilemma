Matlab Code to generate Fig. 3

Just run plot...m file to generate the figure.

It inputs one of 3 datasets (you need to select which one at the top of the code, ended with ...mixed), that can be chosen to generate the choice sets described in Fig. 3.

The inputs are (select one pair only):

distributions7_mixed.m, corresponding to the flat environment
value_actions_gradient7_mixed.m

distributions72_mixed.m, rich environment
value_actions_gradient72_mixed.m

distributions73_mixed.m, poor environment
value_actions_gradient73_mixed.m
